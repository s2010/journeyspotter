# Docker Setup Guide for Public Transport Journey Spotter

## Overview

The Public Transport Journey Spotter has been successfully containerized using Docker, making it easy to deploy and run across different environments without dependency issues.

## Files Created

### Core Docker Files
- `Dockerfile` - Container definition with all dependencies
- `docker-compose.yml` - Service orchestration with volume mounts
- `.dockerignore` - Excludes unnecessary files from build context
- `demo.sh` - Interactive demo script for testing functionality

### Directory Structure

```

## Docker Services

### 1. Main Service (`journey-spotter`)
- Full functionality with camera and display support
- Includes device access for camera recording
- X11 forwarding for display output
- Suitable for development and testing

### 2. Headless Service (`journey-spotter-headless`)
- Server deployment without camera/display requirements
- No device dependencies
- Perfect for production environments
- Activated with `--profile headless`

## Usage Examples

### Quick Start
```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t journey-spotter .

# Run help command
docker run --rm journey-spotter

# Interactive demo
./demo.sh
```

### Docker Compose Usage
```bash
# Headless mode (recommended for servers)
docker-compose --profile headless run --rm journey-spotter-headless python journey_spotter.py --help

# Full mode (requires camera/display)
docker-compose run --rm journey-spotter python journey_spotter.py --help
```

### Manual Docker Commands
```bash
# Train model
docker run --rm -it \
  -v $(pwd)/data:/app/data \
  -v $(pwd)/models:/app/models \
  journey-spotter python journey_spotter.py --train

# Detect anomalies
docker run --rm -it \
  -v $(pwd)/videos:/app/videos \
  -v $(pwd)/models:/app/models \
  -v $(pwd)/output:/app/output \
  journey-spotter python journey_spotter.py \
  --input /app/videos/your_video.mp4 \
  --model /app/models/journey_model.pth \
  --output-csv /app/output/anomalies.csv
```

## Volume Mounts

The Docker setup uses persistent volumes for:
- `./data:/app/data` - Training videos and extracted frames
- `./models:/app/models` - Trained model files (.pth)
- `./output:/app/output` - Detection results and CSV files
- `./videos:/app/videos` - Input videos for processing

## Key Features

### Professional Implementation
- No emojis in scripts or output (professional appearance)
- Clean error messages with clear prefixes (ERROR:, SUCCESS:)
- Comprehensive logging and status updates
- Proper exit codes for automation

### Cross-Platform Compatibility
- Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows with Docker Desktop
- Handles camera access differences between platforms
- Graceful fallback for missing hardware

### Production Ready
- Optimized Docker image with minimal attack surface
- Proper dependency management
- Volume persistence for data and models
- Environment variable configuration

## Testing Results

✅ Docker image builds successfully  
✅ Container runs without errors  
✅ Help command displays correctly  
✅ Volume mounts work properly  
✅ Demo script executes successfully  
✅ Both regular and headless modes functional  

## Troubleshooting

### Camera Access Issues
- On Linux: Ensure user is in video group
- On macOS: Camera access in Docker requires additional setup
- Fallback: Use headless mode for server deployments

### Permission Issues
```bash
# Fix volume permissions
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER data models output videos
```

### Display Issues (Linux)
```bash
# Allow X11 forwarding
xhost +local:docker
```

## Next Steps

1. **Add sample videos** to the `videos/` directory for testing
2. **Record normal behavior** using the recording functionality
3. **Train the model** on your specific environment
4. **Deploy to production** using the headless Docker Compose service
5. **Integrate with CI/CD** pipelines for automated deployment

## Performance Notes

- Initial Docker build takes ~2-3 minutes
- Subsequent builds use cached layers (much faster)
- GPU acceleration available if NVIDIA Docker runtime installed
- Memory usage: ~2-4GB during training, ~1GB during inference

This Docker setup provides a robust, scalable foundation for deploying the Public Transport Journey Spotter in any environment.
